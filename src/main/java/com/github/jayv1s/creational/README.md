# CREATIONAL PATTERNS
## Way of create objects!

------

### WHAT IS?
Design patterns with the objective of deal with creation mechanism; Those patterns try to simplify/standardize the object creation.

### WHY?
Even though create a new object isn't that hard (for example, you can use the keyword "new"), sometimes, you don't want to know all the logic and responsibility about around that creations; also, sometimes you want the flexibility of create that object based on what you need. 

Through the creational pattern is possible to achieve of those needs and more (re-usability, decoupling, etc.)!
